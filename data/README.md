We collected data from different people by strapping a phone onto their chest and having them perform specific sequences of movements.
Participants moved from a standing position to a pushup position and then back to a standing position (without performing the actual pushup in between). The same method was used for situps.
These sequences were recorded as single sessions and later segmented into individual movements using a Python script.

Later on, we also captured participants performing 10 reps of pushups and 10 reps of situps.
The data collection process was time-consuming and tedious, so we were limited to collecting data from only a few people in a small environment.
We initially focused on pushups and situps to improve the quality of our AI modelâ€™s results.
The project is scalable to include other movements in the future.
